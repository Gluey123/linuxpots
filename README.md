Clone this into any linux machines you have in Blue Team challenges. This is mainly for personal use of me. Including a easy cowrie installation script and other linux honey pots. Iptables script to redirect 22 traffic to cowire on 2222

there is a iptables entry for the cowrie pot, I have set it up for automation in the form of a script.

As well as a dns check that was just something extra
