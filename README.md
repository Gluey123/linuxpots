Clone this into any Linux machines you have in Blue Team challenges. This is mainly for my personal use or that of my team.
I have included a "quik" Cowrie installation script that is as plug-and-play as possible. Intended for people who have never installed it before.
Along with this, I have two easy to run scripts to check for serveral errors that I have encountered while insalling on various operating systems.
These include a dns check and iptables script that makes it so that the iptables rules will save after a reboot.
